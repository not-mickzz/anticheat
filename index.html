				<pre class="brush: html">
					SAMPCAC v0.08 released.
					Last SAMPCAC major update (v0.05) was released over 4 months ago and since then several big changes were made, however I didn't implement them in v0.06 or v0.07 because they would have broken backwards compatibility with old scripts.
					Since SA-MP 0.3.8 is right around the corner, I decided to release this update so I could fix any possible issues before migrating to the new SA-MP version which will most likely bring more issues by itself.
					 
					For server owners: 
					 * New SAMPCAC plugin is NOT backwards compatible, so you will have to recompile your scripts and fix possible errors. If you use Att-Def server from SAMPCAC.xyz, redownload the package.
					 * Sample filterscripts and configuration files were revised, so take a look for implementation details or undocumented changes. (hope there aren't any) Check sampcac_testscript.pwn too.
					 * SAMPCAC docs (https://mickzz.xyz/sampcac) were revised&updated (for the first time since v0.01)
					 * sampcac.inc is now properly documented
					 
					Major changes: [BREAKING BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY]
					 * cheat reporting natives were deemed confusing, buggy and unuseful, thus they got removed
					 * CLEO.asi is now reported to the server instead of simply crashing the game
					 * ... so, CLEOs may now be used.
					 * ped.ifp mods are now detectable
					 * CAC_ReadMemory may read up to 4 bytes max
					 * added more game options (disabled by default), full list:
					   * vehicle blips toggling
					   * gun manual reloading
					   * driving cars on water
					   * ped fireproof (no damage from fire)
					   * sprint toggling (no sprint, only on certain surfaces, on all surfaces)
					   * infinite sprint
					   * infinite oxygen
					   * infinite ammo (no reload)
					   * night vision effect toggling (useful for fixing NV bug)
					   * thermal vision effect toggling (useful for fixing NV bug)
					Other changes:
					 * added SA-MP client version checks (you'll get an error message if you're not using 0.3.7 R1)
					 * taking screenshots will trigger a callback in order to prevent abuse
					 * VCRedist isn't shipped anymore, so the installer will be way smaller
					 * CAC_ReadMemory no longer reports back garbage data for some addresses (extra code: https://hastebin.com/gepupufezu.cpp - should report back stamina left)
					 * packets are now properly sanitized preventing malicious clients from doing unwanted memory allocations
					   
					For Att-Def server owners:
					 * SAMPCAC Att-Def v1.21 server package was updated to reflect the new changes
					 * Configuration files were edited, so check (and tweak) them before updating
					 * There is a new command for level 1 admins: /gameoption</pre>
				<pre class="brush: html">
					 SERVER v0.07 QUICK FIX
					 All SAMPCAC server versions prior to v0.08 contain a bug that may be exploited by malicious users to crash the server. Since v0.08 isn't widely used yet, I backported the fix to v0.07.
					 If you're still on v0.07, update the plugin ASAP.</pre>
				<pre class="brush: html">
					CLIENT UPDATE
					SAMPCAC client v0.08.1 released.
					 * fixed server joining bug (Server closed the connection)</pre>
				<pre class="brush: html">
					SERVER UPDATE
					SAMPCAC server v0.08.1 released.
					 * fixed an exploit which could lead to server crash</pre>
				<pre class="brush: html">
					SERVER UPDATE
					SAMPCAC server v0.08.2 released.
					 * content[] is now correctly passed to CAC_OnMemoryRead</pre>
				<pre class="brush: html">
					CLIENT UPDATE
					SAMPCAC client v0.08.2 released.
					 * damage given to in-vehicle players is now properly detected, meaning that:
					   * passengers will take damage
						 * Aimbot (3) won't cause false positives anymore</pre>
				<pre class="brush: html">
					SAMPCAC v0.09 released.
					 * fixed a bug that caused the client not to load on some PCs
					 * fixed a bug that caused players to be autokicked for using keybinders
					 * DirectX updater is now an optional installer component
					 * changed how installer handles files
					 * various server and client improvements</pre>
				<pre class="brush: html">
					SAMPCAC v0.10 released.
					Added new detections for:
					 * no-recoil (#3)
					 * aimbot (#5 and #6)
					 * various actions that will mark the client as untrusted. Note: a clean SA-MP installation would NEVER get marked as untrusted, so it is safe to assume that such a client is malicious.
					Other changes:
					 * CAC__MAX_HARDWARE_ID was increased to 64
					 * in case CAC_ReadMemory fails clientside (eg: non-readable memory), CAC_OnMemoryRead will get called with parameter size = 0
					 * plugin will print a warning message if the version of sampcac.inc doesn't match plugin version
					 * fixed a bug that lead to incorrect cheat detections
					 * fixed a crash that would occur due to excessive keybinder usage
					 * minor improvements to sample scripts
					For server owners:
					 * if you wrote your own detection scripts, recompile them with the new sampcac.inc and make sure that the new cheat ids are properly handled
					 * if you use the default filterscripts, replace them and their configuration files with the ones provided in the server package
					 * if you use Att-Def server from SAMPCAC.xyz, redownload the entire package</pre>
